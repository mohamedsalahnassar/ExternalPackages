# Third-party Extension Support for Partners

Existing third-party extensions are compatible with the AEP Swift SDK without making any changes. This is made possible by the [backward compatible layer](../Migration/Migration_Install.md). Any customer who is consuming a legacy third-party extension is required to use the backwards compatibility layer. We encourage existing partners to test their legacy extensions with the AEP Swift SDK to ensure the extension behaves as expected.
