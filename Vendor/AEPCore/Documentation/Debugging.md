# Implementation Validation with Assurance

The AEP SDK offers an extension to quickly inspect, validate, debug data collection, and experiences for any mobile app using the AEP SDK. We built Assurance to do the heavy lifting of getting an SDK implementation right, so app developers can focus on creating engaging experiences.

## Quick Setup

#### Add Assurance to your app

Include the Assurance extension via Cocoapods.

```ruby
pod 'AEPAssurance','~> 3.0'
```

#### Update Extension Registration

Register Assurance extension by including `Assurance.self` in the list of extensions registered with `MobileCore.registerExtensions`.

```diff
+ import AEPAssurance

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

+  MobileCore.registerExtensions([Assurance.self, Lifecycle.self, Identity.self, Signal.self, ...], {
+     //...
+  })
-  MobileCore.registerExtensions([Lifecycle.self, Identity.self, Signal.self, ...], {
-      //...
-  })

  return true
} 
```

#### Next steps

Now that Assurance is installed and registered with Core, there are just a few more steps required.
