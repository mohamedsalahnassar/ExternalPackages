# Performance Testing

This document provides details about how to collect AEP SDK core components' performance data. To avoid potential performance problems, usually all (or part) of the following steps need to be executed before each core SDK release.

# Test Setup

- Connect a physical iOS device to Xcode
- Open the Xcode project from [here](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-core-ios/tree/main/TestApps), it contains two targets used for performance testing - `PerformanceApp` and `PerformanceTests`

# Performance Metrics

- ### Execution Time

  - Run `PerformanceTests` target 
  - Then the test result will show the execution time of `loading all SDK core conponents` and `evaluating 1000 rules in Rules Engine`

- ### Memory/CPU/Thread Consumption

  - Launch the `PerformanceApp` and open the `debug navigator` view from Xcode.
  - Click the buttons (`Load AEP SDK` and `Evaluate Rules`) on the app, , in the meantime, monitor the memory/cpu/thead usage in Xcode.

- ### Memory Leak

  - Launch the `PerformanceApp` and open the `debug navigator` view from Xcode.
  - Go to `debug navigator` view and select the `Memory` catagory, then click the button `Profile in Instruments` from the right side.
  - Then the `Instruments` tool will show the memory `Allocations` and `Leaks`. if the UI show the green icons, it indicates the test app doesn't have any memory leaks. 

# Performance Baseline 

  - Execution Time
    - `loading all SDK core conponents`       < 2s
    - `evaluating 1000 rules in Rules Engine` < 2s
  - Memory Consumption
    - `loading all SDK core conponents`       < 3M
    - `evaluating 1000 rules in Rules Engine` < 30M
  - Thread Consumption
    - `loading all SDK core conponents`       < 10
    - `evaluating 1000 rules in Rules Engine` â‰ˆ 20-25
