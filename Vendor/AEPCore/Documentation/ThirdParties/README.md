# Third-Party Extension Support

All third-party extensions built on the previous generation of the Adobe Experience Platform will be compatible with the latest AEP Swift SDK. Using existing third-party extensions in AEP Swift can be achieved by using a compatibility layer to bridge between the legacy ACPCore and the new AEPCore. The following documents guide partners who have developed an extension and for customers who are currently using third-party extensions.

## Contents

- For partners, this [document](./Partners.md) will provides all the needed information to ensure each extension continues to function with the latest AEP Swift SDK.
- For customers using third-party extensions, this [document](./Customers.md) will demonstrate how to integrate an existing third-party extension into an AEP Swift SDK implementation.
